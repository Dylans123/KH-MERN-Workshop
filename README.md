# Knight Hacks: Build and Deploy a MERN Application Workshop
This is the repository for all the code written during the Build and Deploy a MERN Application Workshop. The slides from the workshop are available here https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l3dbg7ggdfUuldvDGsDgY-zEO8IHOv52SS4JrQqYsII/edit?usp=sharing and the youtube video of the workshop is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62ZYC7TOfHs.


## Setup
### Dependencies
#### Node and NPM
You'll need these two things since node.js is the programming language we'll be using and npm is the package manager that will give us access to all the different packages we'll need. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ in order to download node and npm.
#### Google Cloud SDK
Google Cloud SDK will let you use the command line tools that we'll need to deploy this application to Google Cloud when we're done. You can download the SDK at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive.
